## FYP
This project was submitted as part of the FYP: Design and Implemetation module in my final year of Computer Science with Data Science in UCD. This was an individual project that delved into the use of Factorisation Machines for Recommendation at Industrial Scale.
I examined two methodologies for that have been developed to generate synthetic data for use in recommender systems.

The 'frac_exp_synth_100k' notebook file includes the implementation and evaluation of the Kronecker Fractal Expansion Methodology. 
The 'sdv' notebook includes the implementation and evaluation of the Synthetic Data Vault Methodology. I used the SDV, Surprise and Implicit python libraries to carry out the evaluations.

The 'ML100k_Real_Metric_Results' notebook provides the metric results for the real data from the Movielens 100k database.
