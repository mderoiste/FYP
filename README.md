## FYP
This project was submitted as part of the FYP: Design and Implemetation module in my final year of Computer Science with Data Science in UCD. It was a 10 credit module supervised by Professor Aonghus Lawlor.
This was an individual project that delved into the use of Factorisation Machines for Recommendation at Industrial Scale.
